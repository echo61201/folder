This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Challenges
1.started using vite first then found out what created was totally client-side 
2.thinking doing README & gitignore manully was dumb so did npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app, this directly creates a nextjs project and gets all the folder tree done, found out it was quite different compared to the tutorial. 
3.start all over again to proceed with the tutorial
4.all good after that
